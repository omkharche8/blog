            <p>Getting a good chunk of 1.5 months to myself straight after 8th grade i assume. Have got tasks to do,
                refining my code proficinecy skills. <br> I don't even have a leetcode account yet and i am here doing
                Computer Science at College Funny enough, I'll create one on 20 May.</p>

            <h4>More Work Less Time Good, Less Work More Time Bad</h4>
            <p>I technically only have 3 modules to do, others i need not learn anything new, but still the
                procastination is decently high.<br> Gotta start my work now. Edit: My Exam was amazing lets see how the
                results go now</p>

            <h4>Summer is in!</h4>
            <p>So I am home now and I got all days to myself, especially doing python. No idea but it just feels too good to practice the language itself. No Jazz just be proficient in doing the same thing. <br> Moreover would like to start a streak on going to gym/involved in physical activity for 40 days straight. Pretty Much possible.<br>Making a navbar at the top to put summer specials tho!
            Working on it simultaneously.</p>

            <h4>Picking up pacee</h4>
            <p>As i go down the summer vacations, trying to do 3 to 4 new array type questions on my <a href="https://github.com/omkharche8/Python">github repo </a> and one on my leetcode profile. I just need to keep on doing progress daily that's the point. <br>
            Personal front its going amazing, I'm able to talk to my already existing friends better(ðŸ˜‰) and efficiently.<br>
            Was thinking on starting a developmental project, will do in June tho!</p>

            <h4>Learning to Dance</h4>
            <p>Yo I have a wedding coming up (My Sisters) in exactly a month from now. So everyone here is going to dance. Even I'm in it!. <br> Learning to Dance is like the most different to learn skill for me. As i have never danced after 6th Grade (Stage Performance) getting those moves out my body is lil time taking but gotta do it. <br> Dance just makes you happy what i observed from practice and makes you feel good about yourself. I liked it, I will rock the dance floor hehehehe.</p>

            <h4>WTF is wrong with me???!!!!</h4>
            <p>Bruh this is the 4th time i'm seeing my GPA and feeling what do i even lack in life. <br> This time i have got 8.5 credits of C grade all super unexpected!!. By 1 mark lost them!!!. DBMS lost A by 2 marks and Sensors by 3 marks and all were because of DAs. <br> I still have no idea what is happening with my life here. Whatever i do i just can't help it. The CGPA still lies at 8.20 which increased by 0.01 this time. I mean *sarcastic laugh* I have nothing to say.</p>
            <p>Today morning the pain was a lot man, it was legit equivalent to something like a heartbreak. The body just pauses and implodes. I hope i recover from this, gotta do something.</p>

            <h4>It's the other part of year now, Half Year Review</h4>
            <p>Man 2024s aging, it's the other part of year now. The summers were thought provoking. I finally got the RAWness what i was looking forward to in life. Thanks to Summers legit</p>
            <p>The first part of year started pretty rough man, felt pretty distracted always whenever i checked my phone, always felt left out of place. Took a lot of friction to understand things. It's pretty important to understand the way you treat the next person, it's not compulsory that the next person will also treat you the same. whatever you do for them, they won't reciprocate it back</p>
            <p>The academics and learning part was decent, nothing to write about it. It just went straight forward as it goes regularl <br>Now, its 3rd Year m8. This year has got the most effort to reward ratio, so i have to embrace myself for that. because i'm here to do something, to have an impact</p>        
            <p>Also my maladaptive day dreaming has to stop. It drains me out always whenever i do it.</p>

            <h4>First Day of College, pretty epic</h4>
            <p>Leaving Home was the toughest thing to ever do, seeing the neighbour hood go away where i did so many things made me sad</p>
            <p>But back to college, took me like 24 hours door to door but was fun. Good talking on the trip.</p>
            <p>Had a magical convesation in the train at night. This happens rarely but it was truly amazing. I felt amazing and it was like heart warming. I hope i know more about this person as time passes, its really interesting and she is fascinating.<br> Too many seniors in the train, got to know about placements and all so that also added up.</p>        
            <p>Skipped first day of class to get a course which i didn't get initially, got it nevertheless. Gave laddoos, felt really happy. Real stuff starts tomorrow. Everything is now set</p>

            <h4>Proper Late night realisation, Holy crap i'm turning 20 next month!!!</h4>
            <p>Currently at home during the TechnoVIT leave and i just realise that I am turning 20 next month. Crazy feeling.</p>
            <p>I have decided to make this the best year of my life, best acads, best outlook, best practices, best decisions. I'm gonna launch for sure for the last 4 months and it's happening.</p>
            <p>The more i visit home i get introduced to the non college life, my college is just too simulated dude and i'm not at all a Fan of that.</p>
            <p>Gotta finish 380 questions with revision this year, it's a goal and i gotta do it to test my dedication towards non-comforting things.</p>
